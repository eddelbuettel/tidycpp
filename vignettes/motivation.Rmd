## Introducing tidyCpp

The `tidyCpp` package offers a simple, small and clean C++ layer over the C API offered by R. This vignette
highlights a few usage examples, often taken from the [_Writing R Extensions_ vignette that comes
with R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html), to highlight some features.

`tidyCpp` has no further dependencies on any other package.  It can however be used with
[Rcpp](https://www.rcpp.org) simply to take advantage of its helper functions `cppFunction()` or
`sourceCpp()`.

`tidyCpp` is still a fairly young and small package.  Please free to contribute by make suggestions,
or sending bugfixes or extension proposals.


### Snippet One: dimnames

This example comes from [Writing R Extension, Section
5.9.4](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Attributes) which highlights
attribute setting from the C API.

It takes two (named) numeric vectors, computes the outer product matrix and uses the names to set
row- and column names. Note that we modified the existing example ever so slight by ensuring (as is
frequently done) remapping of symbols. For example, `length` (which can clash easily with existing
symbols in the global namespace) is now `Rf_length`.  We also added an `export` tag for `Rcpp`
simply to facilitate integration into R.  No Rcpp header or data structures are used; we simply rely
on its logic in getting C or C++ source into R.

::: {.column width="49.75%"}

#### Using the C API for R

```c++
#define R_NO_REMAP
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>

// [[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP out(SEXP x, SEXP y)
{
  int nx = Rf_length(x), ny = Rf_length(y);
  SEXP ans =
    PROTECT(Rf_allocMatrix(REALSXP, nx, ny));
  double *rx = REAL(x),
    *ry = REAL(y),
    *rans = REAL(ans);

  for(int i = 0; i < nx; i++) {
    double tmp = rx[i];
    for(int j = 0; j < ny; j++)
      rans[i + nx*j] = tmp * ry[j];
  }

  SEXP dimnames =
    PROTECT(Rf_allocVector(VECSXP, 2));
  SET_VECTOR_ELT(dimnames, 0,
                 Rf_getAttrib(x, R_NamesSymbol));
  SET_VECTOR_ELT(dimnames, 1,
                 Rf_getAttrib(y, R_NamesSymbol));
  Rf_setAttrib(ans, R_DimNamesSymbol, dimnames);

  UNPROTECT(2);
  return ans;
}
```

:::
::: {.column width="49.75%"}

#### Using tidyCpp


```c++
#include <tidyCpp>
// [[Rcpp::depends(tidyCpp)]]


// [[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP out(SEXP x, SEXP y)
{
  int nx = R::length(x), ny = R::length(y);
  SEXP ans =
    R::Shield(R::allocMatrixReal(nx, ny));
  double *rx = R::numericPointer(x),
    *ry = R::numericPointer(y),
    *rans = R::numericPointer(ans);

  for(int i = 0; i < nx; i++) {
    double tmp = rx[i];
    for(int j = 0; j < ny; j++)
      rans[i + nx*j] = tmp * ry[j];
  }

  SEXP dimnames =
    R::Shield(R::allocVectorList(2));
  R::setVectorElement(dimnames, 0,
                      R::getNames(x));
  R::setVectorElement(dimnames, 1,
                      R::getNames(y));
  R::setDimNames(ans, dimnames);

  return ans;
}
```

::::::

Some key differences:

- a single header `tidyCpp`: simple and clean;
- no `PROTECT` and `UNPROTECT` with manual calling of the number of calls made: C++ takes care of
  that for us via `Shield` which we borrowed (in a simplified form) from Rcpp;
- no `Rf_*` calls: everything used comes from a clean new namespace `R` and is easily identified;
- types are made explicit in the name of the called function sequence rather than enum;
- consistent naming that aligns with language convention:
    - _types_ such as `Shield` are capitalized, and
    - _verbs_ such as the allocators or converters are camelCase;
- overall less wordy and shorter, _e.g._, `R::getNames(x)` instead of `Rf_getAttrib(x, R_NamesSymbol)`;
- no macros are being used.

Note that the use of `Rcpp::export` does not imply use of Rcpp data structures.  We simply take
advantaged of the tried and true code generation to make it easy to call the example from R. You can
copy either example into a temporary file and use `Rcpp::sourceCpp("filenameHere")` on it to run the
example.



### Snippet Two: convolution

This example comes from [Writing R Extension, Section
5.10.1](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Calling-_002eCall) which
introduces the `.Call()` interface of the C API for R.

It takes two numeric vectors and computes a convolution. Note that as above we modified the existing
example ever so slight by ensuring (as is frequently done) remapping of symbols, once again added an
`export` tag for `Rcpp` simply to facilitate integration into R, and changing whitespace.  No Rcpp
header or data structures are used; we simply rely on its logic in getting C or C++ source into R.

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="49.75%"}

#### Using the C API for R

```c++
#define R_NO_REMAP
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>

// [[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP convolve2(SEXP a, SEXP b)
{
  int na, nb, nab;
  double *xa, *xb, *xab;
  SEXP ab;

  a = PROTECT(Rf_coerceVector(a, REALSXP));
  b = PROTECT(Rf_coerceVector(b, REALSXP));
  na = Rf_length(a);
  nb = Rf_length(b);
  nab = na + nb - 1;
  ab = PROTECT(Rf_allocVector(REALSXP, nab));
  xa = REAL(a);
  xb = REAL(b);
  xab = REAL(ab);
  for(int i = 0; i < nab; i++)
    xab[i] = 0.0;
  for(int i = 0; i < na; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < nb; j++)
      xab[i + j] += xa[i] * xb[j];
  UNPROTECT(3);
  return ab;
}
```

// [[Rcpp::depends(tidyCpp)]]


// [[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP convolve2(SEXP a, SEXP b)
{
  int na, nb, nab;
  double *xa, *xb, *xab;
  SEXP ab;

  a = R::Shield(R::coerceVectorNumeric(a));
  b = R::Shield(R::coerceVectorNumeric(b));
  na = R::length(a);
  nb = R::length(b);
  nab = na + nb - 1;
  ab = R::Shield(R::allocVectorNumeric(nab));
  xa = R::numericPointer(a);
  xb = R::numericPointer(b);
  xab = R::numericPointer(ab);
  for(int i = 0; i < nab; i++)
    xab[i] = 0.0;
  for(int i = 0; i < na; i++)
    for(int j = 0; j < nb; j++)
      xab[i + j] += xa[i] * xb[j];
  return ab;
}
```

Like the previous example, the new version operates without macros, does not require manual counting
in `PROTECT` and `UNPROTECT` and is, to our eyes, a little more readable.

(And as above, the two 'tags' for Rcpp use are present only to facilitate use
via the `Rcpp::sourceCpp()` package.)


### Discussion

`tidyCpp` provides a cleaner layer on top of the C API for R. That has its advantages: we find it
more readable. It conceivably has possible disadvantages. Those familiar with the C API for R may
not need this, and may find it an unnecessary new dialect. Time will tell if new adoption and use
may outway possible hesitation by other.  In the meantime, the package "does no harm", has no
further dependencies and can be used, or dropped, at will


### Summary

The `tidyCpp` package provides a cleaner simplifying layer on top of the time-tested but somewhat
crusty C API for R.
